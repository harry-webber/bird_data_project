# **bird_data_project**

Data Project to Analyse UK Bird Populations:
* Project involved analysing bird populations using the BTO Breeding Bird Survey.
* Main deliverable for this project was a presentation which was delivered to a group of my peers and instructors from the Digital Futures Academy.
* Produced a Streamlit dashboard which shows information for a given species, includes...
  * Species dropdown list to select species of interest.
  * Time series graph to show observations in the survey over time.
  * Interactive heatmap with sighting locations.

## **Document Glossary**:

* `BirdApp_v4.py` is the Python file that runs the streamlit dashboard webapp published on streamlit server at https://birddataproject-kytphxsdcneks7odpinzss.streamlit.app/
* `count_by_location.csv` and `species_counts_over_time.csv` are formatted CSV files that are used by the webapp.
* `requirements.txt` are the Python libraries that are the dependencies required for the app to run.
* `project_notebook_main.ipynb` is a Python Notebook file which I used to process data and draft Python functions for the webapp.

All data used for this project was created by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and available online for research purposes at https://zenodo.org/records/14161736.
